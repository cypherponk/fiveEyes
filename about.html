      <p>When I first started getting into computers, I was pretty young. I used to spend hours sitting in front of the screen straining my eyes playing simple Windows Vista games and playing around in Microsoft Paint. Now that I've completed my undergraduate degree, I've been part of the infosec community on Twitter for nearly two years and joined countless Reddit communities which have inspired me to learn as much as I possibly could.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, I didn't find many places where I could find all of the information I wanted in one location--I would fall into poorly written articles or mute YouTube videos with awful stock music taking away the focus.</p>

      <p>fiveEyes is the result of two different capstone projects combined, one for English writing and the other for Information Technology. Although I've finished my course of study, I hope to continue to add information to this site in the future and expand it to become a viable resource for beginners and newbies to the infosec community.</p>
