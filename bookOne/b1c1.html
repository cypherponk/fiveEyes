      <p id="underheading">Introducing... your rights!</p>
      <p><span class="first">When was the first</span> time you distinctly remember using a computer? Five...ten...twenty years ago? Remember the hours of endless fun using a mouse to scribble away in Microsoft Paint or programming in the terminal to
      make a crude children's game. Remember the first time you learned to type, the clacking keys comforting your restless brain into the long hours of the night. Remember downloading all of the music you could think of listening to or streaming
      internet videos for the very first time.</p>
    <p>I remember when my dad brought home that monstrous tower that would wheeze and whine to life at the click of the power button. The glory of Windows XP, such that it was, would be announced with that iconic chime and soon I would get my grubby
      child hands on Windows Movie Maker. I was twelve.</p>
    <p> I wanted to be an animator back then. My little child brain had figured out that I could make computer animations using Paint and Movie Maker, and I would spend hours making little dorky scribbles sync up to music and mouth along to the
      lyrics. Computer lab at school was my favorite--we had iMacs, Apple hardware and fancy software that blew my mind. Not only would Mr. Bruce, our hippie guitar-playing Steve-Jobs-obsessed computer teacher show me how to use iMovie, but he would
      even let me showcase my animated videos at the end of every class like a painful show and tell if I brought it to him on a CD. </p>
    <p> I think my best work was a running cycle of a cat set to Lady Gaga's "Poker Face." (I'm sorry Mr. Bruce's 2009 computer class. I'm also sorry for ruining our DropBox privileges by sending 10,000 copies of trollface onto every computer in the
      classroom and crashing them.)</p>
    <p> Everything changed once I was given an internet stick for my thirteenth birthday. How had I used my computer for nearly two years without this magic? I was suddenly overwhelmed by the vastness of technology. I could talk to my best friend,
      Nora, without having to use the home phone and I could upload my animations and share them on art websites. I could read books and listen to all the music I wanted without begging my parents to buy the CDs. My interests began to shift.</p>
    <p> My best friend's biggest goal was to build a computer. Nora wanted to work for Apple or Google or really any big tech company when she grew up. She had a poster of Steve Jobs in her lime-green origami-filled room, and math was her favorite
      subject because "it just made sense." I was enamored with her aspirations and instantly became likeminded.</p>
    <p> Our thirst for more knowledge was quenched only by use of the internet; it became so extreme that we would do nothing but chat online and send URLs back and forth of interesting forum topics. We didn't even need to hang out anymore.</p>
    <p> Come back to present day. Some of you might relate to this fascination with tech growing up. I don't know, maybe you were scared then and even now you hate to check your emails. My point is that things are changing. We're changing, society is
      marching on strong as ever. But now we're marching along on televisions, on computers, on little magic rectangles thanks to streaming services and social media sites run by billion-dollar corporations. And we can't escape that fact.</p>
    <p> The more technology we own, the more it owns us. Amazon Alexa and Google Home control our living spaces. We install security cameras inside and out, place baby monitors in our children's rooms. Televisions hang in every room of the house. We
      have computers and smartphones and smartwatches that record our heart rate skyrocketing as we listen to the radio in our self-driving cars. We buy our children video games and drones as Christmas presents and expect that everything will be the
      same as it has always been. It isn't the same.</p>
    <p> So what's really all that different besides having all this great tech? Shouldn't I be happy that I can stream New Order's "Blue Monday" every Monday as I drive to work--which by the way is only made possible because of computers? I'll tell
      you what's different: our rights as American citizens. Or as human individuals, for that matter, and no rendition of "Blue Monday" is ever going to trump that.</p>
    <p> The most common argument against the view that people should have the right to privacy is that they have nothing to hide. You've been conditioned into giving up your rights for some sort of benefit. What's the benefit? Higher security? There
      are ways to protect our country other than access to your personal texts.</p>
    <p> Take for example this conversation that a surveillance software might capture and log with your personal information:</p>
    <div class="img">
      <img src="../images/image1.png" />
    </div>
    <p> BAM! National security crisis averted! Our country is now safer thanks to a breach of your privacy! </p>
    <p> Obviously the above is a joke, but it's worrying that these messages (and other more revealing texts too) can be tracked to you and the receiver.</p>
    <p> I won't deny that we need surveillance. In fact, I think it's an integral part of a society run by a government that is supposed to keep its citizens safe. A lot of the laws that made the framework for the surveillance of your personal
      information were enacted right after the 9/11 attacks, and Americans needed to feel safe after something so devastating. 9/11 was 18 years ago though, and there are some things that need to change--starting with the attitudes of people just
      like yourself. But, as soon as you realize that it's okay to stand up for your rights, you'll be taking on a very heavy responsibility.</p>
    <p> Most people in this world are followers, despite what they might think. This means we're easily manipulated into "following the leader." Genetically speaking, we're wired as pack animals. We want a leader to tell us what to do, we like to act
      and think as a society. But all it takes is one idea to start a movement and suddenly everything goes to shit!</p>
    <p> Have you ever watched the X Files? I know it's not really "cool" to watch depreciated shows from the 90s (though "retro" is making a comeback) but I really imagine myself as Fox Mulder here. I'm obsessed with everything surveillance and
      online security. My friend Riley is definitely the Scully type. She doesn't care much about "this whole privacy thing." She's very straight-to-it and determined to get from point A to point B without any technology nonsense
      getting in her way.</p>
    <p> "Aaron would you please just tell me how to load Gmail onto my phone," she says. "No, I don't care that Google reads my emails!" She'll insist this before I can open my mouth to answer her. It isn't my fault I'm passionate about this stuff.
    </p>
    <p> What I'm saying is that whether you're a Mulder or a Scully or something in-between, </p>
    <p> Now before you pass judgement and toss my writing in the trash for being some whacky conspiracy-touting know-it-all computer Mulder wannabe trying to shove an agenda down your throat, I want to make one thing clear: this book isn't to tell
      you what you should or should not do. I've done a lot of reading, a lot of research, and I've stumbled onto things that truly frightened me.</p>
    <p> I want to take this information, strip away the unnecessary bits and bytes, and compile it all into something coherent for you to understand. Not that it isn't possible to understand without a filter, but sometimes these things need context.
      Sometimes things are easier to swallow with context.</p>
    <p> I want you to sit down, strap in, grab a cup of coffee, and place some tape over your computer's webcam.</p>
