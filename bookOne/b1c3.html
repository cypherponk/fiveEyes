      <p id="underheading">The power of the PATRIOT act.</p>
      <span class="first">Librarians are powerful.</span> Not only do they rule over the sacred realm of books and bestow the power of the Almighty Library Card to us ordinary folk, but they are our protectors against the United States Government.
    </p>
    <p> In 2005, George Christian, the executive director of Library Connection in Windsor, Connecticut, was presented with a piece of paper from a pair of FBI agents. </p>
    <p> “We need to see your subscriber information, billing information, and access logs of any person or entity that used your library network’s computers between 4 p.m. and 4:45 p.m. on the 15th of February,” said one agent.[1] The black-suited
      pair explained that the piece of paper, called a national security letter or NSL, urged Christian to turn over the information in order to “protect against international terrorism.” </p>
    <p> The agent pointed out a line in the letter: the letter’s recipient was not to disclose “to any person that the FBI [had] sought or obtained access to information or records.” </p>
    <p> Christian wasn’t buying it. </p>
    <p> “I believe this is unconstitutional,” he said.[1] His words were met by a second offering from the agent—a business card— and the advice to have Christian’s lawyer call the FBI. He did as soon as the pair left. </p>
    <p> “Where is the court order?” asked Peter Chase, a fellow library director and Christian’s second phone call recipient after he had spoken to his lawyer. Christian replied through the phone that there wasn’t a court order and that the FBI had
      stated they didn’t need one. </p>
    <p> It wasn’t long before the Library Connection’s executive committee was called to meet over the letter. The group of four— Christian, Chase, Janet Nocek, and Barbara Bailey—as well as their attorney each took a turn reading the NSL, passing it
      around like a bowl of mashed potatoes at a family dinner. Except that the bowl of mashed potatoes was rotten and contaminated with the plague, and now they were all infected. </p>
    <p> The group’s attorney explained that, because they had all read the letter, they were all bound by its terms. It meant that a gag had been placed on each of them, forcing their mouths to keep shut about the letter and its proceedings. This was
      the beginning of the Connecticut Four. </p>
    <p> Once their gag order was lifted, the Connecticut Four publicly challenged the constitutionality of national security letters in court, arguing that it was an abuse of power and an infringement of a person’s right to privacy. They weren’t
      wrong; between 2003 and 2005, the FBI had issued over 143,000 NSLs with only one resulting in a successful conviction. In the past ten years, the FBI has issued over 300,000 NSLs. </p>
    <p> Thanks to The USA PATRIOT Act enacted in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks, the government no longer required approval from a judge to serve NSLs. Each NSL collects the personal data of a large number of individuals while also forcing those
      affected to live under a gag order—they can’t speak about receiving the letter or having any involvement with the FBI. </p>
    <p> “Living under the gag order has been stressful and surreal,” said Nicholas Merrill in an anonymous editorial published by The Washington Post.[2] He was the first person to challenge the constitutionality of NSLs in court after being served
      one himself. </p>
    <p> “Under the threat of criminal prosecution, I must hide all aspects of my involvement in the case...from my colleagues, my family and my friends. When I meet with my attorneys, I cannot tell my girlfriend where I am going or where I have
      been.”[2] </p>
    <p> Merrill goes on to say that he “resent[s] being conscripted as a secret informer for the government,” forced to lie to those around him. </p>
    <p> For those bound by the gag order, all expressed frustration at not being able to contact congress members with their experiences and advocate for change until their gag orders were lifted, usually several months after their NSLs were served.
    </p>
    <p> Thankfully the advocacy for change was heard, and in 2015 President Barack Obama signed the USA FREEDOM Act. This limited the amount of data that could be collected by the FBI and gave more opportunities to companies served with NSLs to
      publicly report information about the number they’ve received. It also renewed the PATRIOT Act provision Section 215. </p>
    <p> Since 2006, the NSA has been collecting the phone records, e- mail metadata, internet searches, and credit card transactions of millions of Americans without their knowledge. The reason they can get away with it is all thanks to Section 215
      of the PATRIOT Act, commonly referred to as the “library records” provision. </p>
    <p> Section 215 allows the Director of the FBI or a designated official to order materials to aid in investigations against terrorism or for intelligence activities. These materials include “books, records, papers, documents, and other items”
      listed as “tangible things.” </p>
    <p> Because 215 carries a gag order, it’s sparked the use of warrant canaries, or signs posted publicly that announce a company or service has not been secretly subpoenaed. </p>
    <p> Companies such as Adobe, Pinterest, Tumblr, and Wikipedia all display warrant canaries on their sites, and physical buildings such as libraries may do the same posted on announcement boards. </p>
    <p> If you’ve seen this sign or a variant of it posted on the corkboard of your local library, you can feel both safe and assured that they’re doing their part to protect you and your information. If you don’t see it, try asking one of the
      librarians if they’re aware of the warrant canary’s purpose. If they say they’re aware but don’t directly answer why the sign isn’t up, there’s a good chance the FBI has placed a gag order on that branch and a possibility that your information
      has been seized by the government. </p>
