          <span class="first">On the 12th of</span> July, 2007, the US military engaged in an airstrike on a group of men walking the streets of New Baghdad, Iraq. The gunsight camera mounted on Apache helicopter captured the visceral scene as eighteen
          people were obliterated by hundreds of 30mm rounds, their bodies left lying in the dirt. Among the dead were two journalists working for Reuters, Saeed Chmagh and Namir Noor-Eldeen. Two children were severely injured in a second round of
          gunfire, aimed to destroy a rescue van. In a third attack, the Apache helicopter sent three Hellfire missiles into a civilian building where three families resided. The soldiers could be heard laughing in the transmissions.</p>
        <p> The US military answered the demands of Reuters with a statement that they had no idea how their reporters had been killed. They never answered Reuters’ filing of the Freedom of Information Act to release the video that would answer their
          questions, insisting that their soldiers were in line with the military’s “Rules of Engagement.”</p>
        <p> On the 5th of April, 2010, WikiLeaks released the classified video depicting these attacks to the world. Chelsea Manning, then US Private Bradley Manning, was charged with leaking the video and sentenced to 35 years in prison for espionage
          and theft. The result was a potent fuel for activists that ignited with the snap of a finger.</p>

        <p> WikiLeaks was founded in 2006 by Julian Assange, a programmer, journalist, and activist with a genius-level IQ. The website, originally hosted in Sweden, was created to act as a platform for confidential information to be shared globally.</p>
        <p> You’ve heard of the Clinton email scandal back in 2016 where over 1,200 emails from a private email server were released to the public. WikiLeaks was behind it. WikiLeaks was also responsible for leaking the Guantanamo Bay’s “Camp Delta
          Standard Operating Procedure” which detailed the torture of prisoners, the “secret bibles” of Scientology, and the CIA’s software used to hack into civilian smartphones and computers, dubbed “Vault 7.”</p>
        <p> WikiLeaks’ platform makes it possible for those who wish to submit classified or high-profile documents of great importance while keeping the leakers anonymous. Obviously some leakers’ identities have been revealed, such as the case of
          Chelsea Manning, but these are usually from third parties and other circumstances. (Manning confided online to hacker Adrian Lamo, who reported Manning to the Defense Department.)</p>
        <p> WikiLeaks isn’t the only platform activists can publish on, but it’s certainly one of the most well-known. Arguably the most famous leaks of the 21st century were the Snowden Revelations, not published on WikiLeaks but instead through a group
          of hand-picked journalists. There’s a term for it: the “Post-Snowden Era.”</p>
        <p> In 2006, Snowden worked for the CIA as an information technologist, but in 2009 he transferred jobs to work for Dell after being suspected of breaking into classified files. After Dell, he worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, an NSA subcontractor,
          for three months.</p>
        <p> While employed at Booz Allen, Snowden once again came into contact with top-secret NSA documents that fueled his dislike for their intrusive and alarming practices. He began to copy the files, amassing a vast library of the NSA’s practices,
          and in 2013 he took a leave of absence claiming he had been diagnosed with epilepsy.</p>
        <p> Knowing what he was about to do would result in imprisonment or even death, Snowden fled the country to reside in Hong Kong, China. He reached out to three journalists and a filmmaker: Barton Gellman of The Washington Post, Glenn Greenwald
          and Ewen MacAskill of The Guardian, and Laura Poitras, who also had experience in investigative reporting.</p>
        <p> What this group released on the 5th and 6th of June that year sent the government into chaos. This was the first time we had ever learned about the extent of our government’s surveillance, the programs and software they had been developing to
          spy on us and completely disregard our freedoms and basic rights as American citizens.</p>
        <p> Snowden’s leaks also brought a focus onto what’s called the Five Eyes surveillance alliance. The Five Eyes, also known as the Nine Eyes and Fourteen Eyes respectively, consist of agencies around the world that collect your data and record
          your activities. The Five Eyes consist of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
        <p> The Five Eyes alliance originally emerged from a secret agreement back in 1941 to share intelligence. The agreement concluded that all parties would share things such as the collection of communications documents and equipment as well as the
          “acquisition of information regarding communications organizations, procedures, practices and equipment.”</p>
        <p> The alliance remained active throughout the Cold War and onward, remaining active to this day with even broader alliances: the Nine Eyes consists of the Five Eyes plus Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and Norway; the Fourteen Eyes consists
          of the Nine Eyes plus Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Sweden.</p>
