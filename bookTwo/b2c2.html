        <p><span class="first">In the last chapter,</span> I outlined what an ethical hacker is, what their role may entail, and why they are so important.</p>

        <p>In specifics, the ethical hacker should possess a very high or professional level of several skills. Often, job descriptions for this type of career require certifications, such as the <a href="https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/">Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)</a>, the <a href="https://www.giac.org/certification/penetration-tester-gpen">GIAC Penetration Tester (GPEN)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/">Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)</a> certification. Every certification is different though, and having one over the other does not necessarily mean a person is either more qualified nor "better" than the other. The exam that is taken depends on the scope of learning of the individual. One who wishes to become fluent in utilizing Kali Linux, for example, might find the best fit for them in taking the OSCP exam. It's also possible to simply take multiple exams, though each of them comes with a hefty price tag and often have specialized programs that prepare the individual for that particular exam.</p>

        <p>Another set of skills an ethical hacker should possess under their belt is to learn a programming language. Tackling the difficult puzzles that are programming languages not only prepares the ethical hacker for thinking both out-of-the-box but teaches both persistance and (maybe most importantly) how to look up the right answer if they become stuck.</p>

        <p>According to several sources online and the personal preferences of the infosec community, some of the best programming languages for pentesters to learn are (in no particular order): Java, JavaScript, C, C++, Python, SQL, PHP, and LISP.</p>

        <p>For those who have never learned a language, it's easy to get lost and overwhelmed. My personal opinion is to first tackle a simple coding language like HTML and CSS and work your way up from there. This allows you to familiarize yourself with working with code and understanding how each part relates to another and, really, helps to understand how a computer functions. From there, tackling PHP and JavaScript is the next logical step. These languages are often all used together with their main functions acting as webpages. Honestly, using these languages can be challenging for the complete beginner, but are lots of fun in the end and (watch out!) can consume entire hours at a time.</p>

        <p>Another good language to have under the beginning ethical hacker's skillset is Python. Python is considered one of the more popular languages because of its ease of use and available documentation. It's also extremely versatile, so there's no need to incorporate other languages into solving an issue (although some infosec individuals will often use one or two languages at a time to sove a problem).</p>

        <p>Java is another widely used, industry-standard programming language. Its specialty can be found in hacking mobile devices, as the language can be found running on millions of devices across the globe. It's also acceptable for reverse engineering software where a program is taken, pulled apart, and then put together again in a way that can potentially be weaponized. A huge plus to writing programs in Java is that the language can be supported on any device that is capable of running it.</p>

        <p>SQL is not exactly a "programming language" per se, but it certainly shows massive potential for learning by ethical hackers because of its use by black hat hackers, or individuals who illegally hack systems. SQL is a database language that allows a local system to communicate with database servers. It's considered the best language to use when hacking into a remote database, and not knowing how the language functions and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp">how it can be weaponized</a> can be a major setback for the ethical hacker.</p>

        <p>One of the more complicated (and possibly outdated) languages that the ethical hacker might possess is LISP. When asked, some of the most experienced, classical ethical hackers stated that this programming language was considered one of the best. Among the community, those who grasp the knowledge and understanding of LISP are held in a higher regard. Its usage is best for breaking into a complex network.</p>

        <p>Although it wasn't mentioned earlier, I wanted to put Bash on this list of languages to learn. This is what can be seen running on movie-style terminal screens, and is a standard for navigating non-GUI or non user-interface platforms. Using a program such as Metasploit, for example, will require the knowledge of Bash. On most Unix / UN*X operating systems, Bash is the default command shell (or Terminal).</p>

        <p>In order to better understand ethical hacking, it's necessary to use the tools that are considered industry standard. In the next chapter, I'll outline how to download and use some simple tools on Kali Linux.</p>
